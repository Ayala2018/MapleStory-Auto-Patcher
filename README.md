# MapleStory Auto Patcher
Implements API calls to download/patch MapleStory with no authentication straight from Nexon.

Since the code for grabbing the ManifestURL actually requires authentification. The manifest URL is instead downloaded from my AWS server. At a later point I'll release a seperate project with the login algorithm and manifest grabber.
